# Topic-Modelling-with-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-LDA-

#### Topic modelling in natural language processing is a technique which assigns topic to a given corpus based on the words or the texts that are present within the corpus. 
#### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an example of topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.
 
 1) Performed EDA and text preprocessing using RegEx, The libraries used for the textual preprocessing include NLTK toolkit, Gensim and SpaCy.
 2) Word Clouds for ascertaining the frequency of words
 3) Computation of Coherence and Perplexity scores ("Number of topics" being a hyperparameter in LDA)
 4) Dominant topic and its percentage contribution in each document
 5) Proportion of documents by the top 6 dominant topics.
 6) Interactive visualization
